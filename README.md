# Real-Estate-Regression-Model

In my DSCI 100 (Introduction to Data Science) course at UBC, we had to make a group project using the tools we learned in R from class.

We chose the topic of predicting price based on house's features using a regression model since real estate is a massive industry which interested us all. We used an open-source dataset on real estate in Toronto to create our model.
 
I had many responsibilities working on this project as I took a leadership role in the group. I wrote part 1 and 3, which were the Introduction and Discussion sections. I also did the majority of Part 2. I cleaned and wrangled the data, split the dataset into training and testing data, and used several R functions and libraries to create various 2d and 3d graphs which helped us understand and visualize our results.
